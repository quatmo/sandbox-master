This is to demonstrate how to approach similar scenarios, not to showcase the interactive capabilities of the CreateJS libraries (ie. the actual interactive piece is intentionally very simple).

Highlights:
- less than 2kb over-the-wire size (gzipped, excluding CDN libraries)
- touch / mobile friendly interactive
- image fallback for older browsers
- render only occurs during interaction, saving CPU and battery
- uses hand cursor to indicate interactive elements
